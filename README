As practice, I'm going through the code, cleaning it up, and making it better.

TODOs
 * Make hlint happy with all the code
 * Replace makeAll.sh script with a real build script
 * Use a .cabal file
 * Rewrite the sql to not suck
 * Use blaze-html (I think?) for generating html
 * Move away from fcgi and use snap framework
 * Write tests
 * Store images on s3
 * Deploy somewhere
 * Slowly rewrite using idiomatic haskell
 * Use postgresql instead of sqlite3
